Flag 1:
    This flag is uses to indicate to the process which sends commands to remote units that something has changed.
    The remote unit will see this, send the required changes, then reset the flag.

    If the write is unsuccessful write to the flag here so a second try can be completed.
    This way it won't affect the working devices if it won't send.
